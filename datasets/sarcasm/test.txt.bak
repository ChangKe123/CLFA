" i sympathize with those women who join the sex-worker\'s movement as a "rebellion against punishment and shame . " but the sex industry , which traffics in human beings , is another matter entirely . bazelon barely mentions the nordic model , which decriminalizes the prostituted person but criminalizes the procurer and the buyer , and she quickly dismisses any evidence that this approach might be successful . in fact , there are many good reasons why this promising model has been adopted by an increasing number of countries each year . any fair treatment of this issue would require serious attention to an approach that addresses the exploitation inherent in the real world of prostitution . i\'m an old lady, and little shocks me these days, but i have to admit i was shocked that the new york times would lend itself to such a blatant brief for commercial sex . if that\'s liberation , spare me . sincerely , judith l. herman, m.d. professor of psychiatry (part time) harvard medical school', 1]
