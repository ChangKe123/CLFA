"president trump\'s speech ignores eight years of economic growth under president obama. his description of what happens in washington in terms of the concentration of wealth sounded like an indictment of the republicans\'trickle-down economics. i\'m glad that he\'s making that statement now, especially as republicans propose new tax breaks for the wealthy. if president trump is sincere about fighting against that failed trickle-down policy that has increased the deficit, caused job loss, and ransacked our investments in the future, democrats look forward to finding common ground with him.
